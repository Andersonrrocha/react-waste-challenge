# Skip Size Selection Challenge

## Overview

This project is a modern and user-friendly interface for skip size selection, with focus on user experience and code quality. Built with React, TypeScript, and modern web development practices.

## 🤔 Approach & Problem Solving

### Initial Analysis

- Started with a thorough review of the provided design and functionality requirements
- Identified opportunities for UX improvements while maintaining core functionality
- Analyzed potential technical challenges and accessibility requirements
- Mapped out component structure and state management needs

### Design Evolution

- Original dark theme limited visibility of key information
- Reimagined with a light theme to highlight important elements
- Maintained dark mode option for user preference
- Enhanced card layout to emphasize:
  - Key skip features
  - Status indicators
  - Selection state
  - Validation messages

### UX Improvements

- Implemented clear visual hierarchy for information scanning
- Added detailed drawer view for selected skips
- Introduced toggle functionality for selection/deselection
- Enhanced feedback for disabled states with clear explanations
- Ensured consistent experience across all screen sizes

### Technical Decisions

- Separated mobile/desktop components to:
  - Maintain clean, specific styling
  - Avoid complex conditional rendering
  - Optimize for different screen sizes
- Implemented proper validation for API responses
- Added comprehensive test coverage post-development
- Focused on accessibility compliance from the start

## 🚀 Key Features

- Modern, responsive interface with dark/light mode support
- Interactive skip selection with detailed information drawer
- Clear visual feedback for all states (selected, disabled, errors)
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Accessibility compliant

## 💻 Technical Stack

- React (Latest Version)
- TypeScript
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
